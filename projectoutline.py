#My project is going to be something similar to the game lightbikes from tron the movie
#My first major milestone, is to set the boundaries of the area were the bikes run in
#I do not know how to insert images in python, I know we have learned how to do it, but I forgot about them
#I do not think my project is too ambitious
#I think maybe my project is too easy to do.
